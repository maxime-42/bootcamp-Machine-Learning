    Shuffles and splits the dataset (given by x and y) into a training and a test set,
    while respecting the given proportion of examples to be kept in the training set.
    Args:
        x: has to be an numpy.array, a matrix of dimension m * n.
        y: has to be an numpy.array, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        proportion: has to be a float, the proportion of the dataset that will be assigned to the
